                    Balakrishna was born in 1960 in Chennai (then Madras), Tamil Nadu to Telugu actor and three-time former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao (NTR) and his wife Basavatarakam.[11][12] As the Telugu film industry was based in Madras at the time, he spent his entire childhood in Madras. During his adolescence, he moved to Hyderabad following the shifting of the Telugu film industry to that city. He earned a bachelor's degree in commerce from Nizam College, Hyderabad, Telangana[when?]. In 1982, at the age of 22, Balakrishna married Vasundhara Devi, and they have three children.[citation needed]

                    In 2000, Balakrishna acted in Goppinti Alludu, directed by E V V Satyanarayana with Simran. In 2001, he starred in the B. Gopal-directed faction film Narasimha Naidu, opposite Simran once again. The film became the highest-grossing Telugu film of all time until the record was broken by Chiranjeevi's Indra, which was also directed by B. Gopal.[citation needed] Balakrishna won his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance.[citation needed] In the same year, he appeared in Bhalevadivi Basu with Shilpa Shetty and Anjala Zhaveri.[16] His 2002 and 2003 films include Seema Simham and Chennakeshava Reddy. The former received unfavourable reviews and was a box office flop, but the latter one was critically and financially successful.[original research?] In 2004, he performed in a remake of the 2003 Tamil film Saamy, titled Lakshmi Narasimha, with Asin Thottumkal. The film and Balakrishna's performance won critical acclaim and was a financial success.[17][18] During the period, he also announced plans to act and direct in the remake of Nartanasala, and a launch event was held in Hyderabad in March 2003. Produced by Pusapati Lakshmipati Raju, the film was announced to have an ensemble cast also featuring Soundarya, Srihari, Saikumar, Uday Kiran and Asin in lead roles.[19] However, despite a grand launch, the film was later shelved following the sudden demise of Soundarya.[20]

                    The years from 2005 to 2009 saw action-drama flicks such as Vijayendra Varma, Veerabhadra, Allari Pidugu, Okka Magadu and Maharadhi which did not perform well at the box office.[21] He paired with Sneha and Tabu in the mythological movie Panduranga (2008), directed by K. Raghavendra Rao. He played the dual roles of Krishna and Panduranga.[22] Rediff described his performance as "Balakrishna does justice to both the roles of God and Ranga. He shines in the climax of the movie. It's quite a task to step into NTR's shoes, but his son has done pretty well, though one does miss NTR in the role of Krishna!".[23] The film was an average success and his performance won him the Santosham Best Actor Award.[24] In the year 2009, he starred in the family drama Mithrudu, alongside Priyamani in a slightly different role â€“ that of a dependable friend and confidante to the female lead. The film opened to average reviews.[25]
